# Contributions
- (Very) loosly based on Johan Fält's World of Darkness 20th edition as inspiration, (credit to [johanfk#0054]("https://github.com/JohanFalt/Foundry_WoD20))

# From Johan's ReadMe:
- Original code for dot/box counters and how to get these to work from Foundry-V5 (credit to [erizocosmico](https://github.com/erizocosmico/foundry-V5)) 
- Code for the input/selector with permission from https://gitlab.com/MarlQ/mta

Systems I have checked to learn general structure and the typical "how do you do this?":
